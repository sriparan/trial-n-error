simple express server in ts.

npm init, tcs init,
install the dependencies.
updated the tsconfig.json for small tweaks of the source location and build outs.
trying to have the convention of folder named "out" to push the build outputs to.

run from the root dir. Where this file is located :)
npm install
tcs && node out/server.js

Have a dotenv package , basic usage to read paramenters in a .env file.
